# SplashBuddy

SplashBuddy goal is to provide an *elegant* and *secure* onboarding process for Mac users using [DEP](https://www.apple.com/business/dep/). 

It allows you to:

- Prevent your users from using their Mac before the minimum software is installed
- Provide status on the software that is currently being installed
- Display important information

It currently supports Jamf Pro. You're welcome to [contribute](https://github.com/ftiff/SplashBuddy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to the project. Every little helps.
